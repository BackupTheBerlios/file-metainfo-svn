Plugins and Modules
===================

Plugins are executed when the DB is updated. They extract informations that are put into the DB and so suitable for searches.

Modules are executed when the FileInfo is updated. They extract informations that change often and that are not usefull for searches such as size, desktop file icon, etc etc
